# Space Patrol

This repository contains the core source code for Space Patrol. A maintained built version is freely available from www.jddesign.co.uk and here.

Some of the references are to sources in other private projects, so this solution won't build as it stands - though these are only periphery functions. All the core source code is here.

I build this code with Visual Studio 2022, and use Visual Studio's static code analysis, and the excellent PVS-Studio tool to ensure the inevitable silly mistakes we all make are found (and fixed) as soon as possible.
