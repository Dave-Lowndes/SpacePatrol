<h1>Space Patrol V2.4</h1>
<p>Space Patrol monitors the available space on your local hard disk drives and provides a notification when the configurable threshold level is reached.</p>
<p>Unlike the built-in provision in some of the Windows operating systems, Space Patrol gives you full control over the threshold level and, where possible, 
provides a consistent notification user interface for all supported versions of Windows.</p>
<h4>Space Patrol - Copyright © 2002-2022 JD Design, All Rights Reserved</h4>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>Expand the zip file to a directory on your machine and run the setup program.</p>
<p>Follow the on-screen 
instructions to complete the installation.</p>
<p>During setup, you'll have the opportunity to configure the settings, and once you've completed that, the last step of Setup informs you that Space Patrol is 
installed and briefly tells you how to use it. If you're upgrading an existing version, setup may need to restart Windows.</p>
<h3>Administration Installation</h3>
<p>The installer supports the MSI administrative installation options. For example:</p>
<p class="indent-code">msiexec /jm spacecon.msi</p>
<p>"Advertises" Space Patrol on all the machine's users Programs menu items.<br>When a user invokes the Start-&gt;Programs-&gt;JD Design-&gt;Space Patrol-&gt;Space Patrol 
Documentation option, the installation will complete.</p>
<p>or:</p>
<p><span class="indent-code">msiexec /a spacecon.msi</span></p>
<p>Performs an "administrative" installation to a shared network location.</p>
<h2>How Do You Use Space Patrol?</h2>
<p>Setup configures Space Patrol to start monitoring automatically when you log onto the computer. It does this by adding a 
<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa376977(v=vs.85).aspx" target="_blank">
registry setting to automatically start the monitor program when you log in.</a></p>
<p>You can configure Space Patrol during Setup, or at any time, by using Start-&gt;Programs-&gt;JD Design-&gt;Space Patrol-&gt;Configure Space Patrol.</p>
<p>Note that 
the configuration program requires elevated permissions. If you have UAC enabled, you'll be prompted by Windows UAC when you start it.</p>
<p>The Space Patrol configuration program displays your disk drive information and suggests where you may want to alter the setting.</p>
<p class="indent"><img alt="Space Patrol Configuration dialog" src="ConfigDlg.png"></p>
<p>Monitoring can be enabled per-disk drive, and for 
those operating systems that have an inbuilt low disk space notification facility, Space Patrol lets you disable the operating system's facility.</p>
<p>For Windows XP and later, this setting affects the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Explorer NoLowDiskSpaceChecks 
registry setting.</p>
<ol>
	<li>To alter the threshold setting, select the drive and double click (or use the Modify button).</li>
	<li>Alter the notification level using the "Modify Notification Threshold" dialog.
		<p><img alt="Modify Threshold Dialog" src="ThresholdDlg.png"></p>
	</li>
	<li>If you want to disable the operating system facility, check the "Disable the operating system's built-in low-disk space checking facility" button.</li>
	<li>When you've configured the settings to be how you want them, press the Apply button to commit the settings.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you've altered the settings so that the low space setting is effective, you should see a notification icon appear in the taskbar notification area and, 
depending on your version of Windows, a popup notification indication. This notification will recur periodically, getting less frequent the longer 
the low disk space situation persists - so as not to annoy you too much if you choose to ignore it.</p>
<p><img alt="Notification Icon for Windows 8.1" class="rhs-img" height="128" src="Notification%20on%20Win8.1.png" style="float: right" width="360"></p>
<p>Here's how the notification looks under Windows 8.1. The actual presentation 
is different under different versions of Windows.</p>
<p>An unregistered version contains the full functionality but won't automatically apply the saved settings when you log on - you have to run the "Configure 
Space Patrol" menu item and press the Apply button.</p>
