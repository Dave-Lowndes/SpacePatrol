<h1>Space Patrol</h1>
<p>Space Patrol monitors the available space on your local hard disk drives and provides a notification when the configurable threshold level is reached.</p>
<p>Unlike the built-in provision in some of the Windows operating systems, Space Patrol gives you full control over the threshold level and provides a consistent notification user interface for all supported versions of Windows.</p>

<h2><a name="Installation"></a>Installation</h2>
<ol>
	<li>Expand the zip file to a directory on your machine and run the setup program.</li>
	<li>Follow the on-screen 
instructions to complete the installation.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Administration Installation</h3>
<p>The installer supports the MSI administrative installation options. For example:</p>
<p class="indent-code">msiexec /jm spacecon.msi</p>
<p>"Advertises" Space Patrol on all the machine's users Programs menu items.<br>When a user invokes 
any of the Space Patrol start menu shortcuts the installation will complete.</p>
<p>or:</p>
<p><span class="indent-code">msiexec /a spacecon.msi</span></p>
<p>Performs an "administrative" installation to a shared network location.</p>
<h2><a name="Using SP"></a>How Do You Use Space Patrol?</h2>
<ol>
	<li>Once installed, run the Space Patrol Monitor program from your Start menu. 
You'll only need to do this once as it will start automatically when you next 
log on. It does this by adding a
	<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa376977(v=vs.85).aspx" target="_blank">registry setting to automatically start the monitor program when you log in.</a></li>
	<li>To configure the threshold level for each of your disk drives, run the 
"Configure Space Patrol" program from your Start menu.<br>Note that the 
	configuration program requires elevated permissions. If you have UAC 
	enabled, you'll be prompted by Windows UAC when you start it.</li>
</ol>
<p>The Space Patrol configuration program displays your disk drive information and suggests where you may want to alter the setting.</p>
<p class="indent">
<img alt="Main UI screenshot" longdesc="Space Patrol dialog screenshot" src="configdlg.png" height="260" width="842"></p>
<p>Monitoring can be enabled per-disk drive, and for 
those operating systems that have an inbuilt low disk space notification facility, Space Patrol lets you disable the operating system's facility.</p>
<p>For Windows XP and later, this setting affects the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Explorer NoLowDiskSpaceChecks 
registry setting.</p>
<ol>
	<li>To alter the threshold setting, select the drive and double click (or use the Modify button).</li>
	<li>Alter the notification level using the "Modify Notification Threshold" dialog.
		<p>You can enter the threshold level as either MB or GB.
		<img alt="Modify dialog screenshot" longdesc="Modify Notification Threshold dialog screenshot" src="thresholddlg.png" class="rhs-img" height="180" width="295"></p>
	</li>
	<li>If you want to disable the operating system facility, check the "Disable the operating system's built-in low-disk space checking facility" button.</li>
	<li>When you've configured the settings to be how you want them, press the Apply button to commit the settings.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you've altered the settings so that the low space setting is effective, you should see a notification icon appear in the taskbar notification area and, 
depending on your version of Windows, a popup notification indication. This notification will recur periodically, getting less frequent the longer 
the low disk space situation persists - so as not to annoy you too much if you choose to ignore it.</p>
<p><img alt="Notification Icon for Windows 8.1" class="rhs-img" height="128" src="Notification%20on%20Win8.1.png" style="float: right" width="360"></p>
<p>Here's how the notification looks for Windows 8.1. The actual presentation 
is different for different versions of Windows.</p>
<p style="clear:both">For example, here's how it looks for Windows 10:<img alt="" class="rhs-img" style="float:right" src="notification%20on%20win10-2.png" height="202" width="369"></p>
<p style="clear:both">While hovering the mouse over the notification icon shows:
<img alt="" src="notification%20on%20win10-1.png" class="rhs-img" style="float:right" height="56" width="324"></p>
