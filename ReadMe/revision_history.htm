	<h1>Space Patrol Revision History</h1>
	<h4>V2.5.2.0&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1 October 2025</h4>
	<p>Eliminate periodic beeping after sleep/hibernation due to failure to 
	update/delete the notification icon.</p>
	<p>Reduce length of tip text so that it fits on a line and doesn't naturally 
	wrap.</p>
	<h4>V2.5.1.0&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 13 May 2025</h4>
	<p>Update per-monitor DPI for correct behaviour on Windows 11 by using 
	PerMonitorV2 mode.</p>
	<p>Add (slightly) higher resolution notification icon format for high DPI 
	usage.</p>
	<p>Optimize icon usage and switch icon if the primary monitor's DPI changes.</p>
	<h4>V2.5.0.0&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1 May 2025</h4>
	<p>
		Work-around for a change in Windows 10 that issues the "TaskbarCreated"
		notification when the primary monitor's DPI is changed.
		This caused failure when re-adding the notification icon, giving rise to an audible beep.
	</p>
	<p>
		Fix for the situation when removing the notification icon may randomly
		fail, giving rise to an audible beep.
	</p>
	<p>
		Enhanced the "Modify Notification Threshold" dialog to allow entry in
		either MB or GB.
	</p>
	<p>Enable/Disable the Apply button appropriately.</p>
	<p>
		Periodically refresh the drive list items to reflect any changes to disk
		space that occur.
	</p>
	<p>Show a tooltip for any partially shown text in the drives list.</p>
	<p>Suppress audible beep when subsequently updating the notification icon.</p>
	<p>
		The Configure Space Patrol program is now per-monitor Hi-DPI aware so that moving it across different DPI
		monitors maintains an optimal window size.
	</p>
	<p>Update documentation URLs.</p>
	<h4>V2.4.1.0&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 10 January 2023</h4>
	<p>Updated email contact information.</p>
	<p>Internal code changes.</p>
	<h4>V2.4.0.0&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 17 October 2022</h4>
	<p>Now freely available.</p>
	<p>Changed the setup - no longer start the programs as they ran as the System account, not the user account.</p>
	<p>Lots of internal changes to tidy up the code.</p>
	<h4>V2.3.0.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 16 September 2018</h4>
	<p>Fix for the Configure... context menu operation.</p>
	<h4>V2.3.0.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 9 Feb 2018</h4>
	<p>
		Updated to change the start-up mechanism from using the start-up program
		folder, to a registry entry under the (32-bit)
		HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run key.
	</p>
	<p>
		The reason for this change is that the Windows 10 Task Manager Start-up tab
		(and Windows Settings, Start-up) displayed the Space Patrol Monitor item as a
		curious number rather than using the program name, which made it look
		suspicious. Using the registry key to start up the monitor application shows the
		correct information.
	</p>
	<p>
		If you've made any changes to the configuration and haven't applied them,
		you're now prompted if you try to close the dialog.
	</p>
	<p>
		On a clean system with no saved settings, the default alarm at point now
		defaults to 15% of the drive size rather than zero.
	</p>
	<h4>V2.3.0.0&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1 Nov 2014</h4>
	<p>Minor revisions to the UI and documentation after testing for compatibility with the Windows 10 Technical Preview notification center facility.</p>
	<p>The configuration dialog is now much wider so you can read more of the text without scrolling.</p>
	<p>The Help button now invokes the HTML documentation since WinHelp isn't readily available on newer versions of Windows.</p>
	<h4>V2.2.1.1 7 - Aug 2008</h4>
	<p>
		Fix for unregistered operation under Windows Vista. If you allowed the
		initial notification message box to time out, the monitor process would close.
	</p>
	<h4>V2.2.1.0 - 26 Nov 2006</h4>
	<p>
		Windows Vista compatible version.<br />
		Reworked to separate the monitoring and configuration functionality into<br />
		separate programs so that it works with Vista UAC.
	</p>
	<h4>V2.2.0.0 - 9 April 2006</h4>
	<p>
		Installation defaults to &quot;everyone&quot;.<br />
		Cosmetic changes to balloon tooltip texts.<br />
		Adopted the new registration number scheme used by our other products.<br />
		Fix some potential issues highlighted by Visual Studio&#39;s static code analysis &amp;
		Application Verifier tools.
	</p>
	<h4>V2.1.0.1 - 19 April 2004</h4>
	<p>
		Fixes a cosmetic issue where the &quot;Disable operating system&#39;s built-in
		low-disk space checking facility&quot; check box was not being set correctly under
		Windows 98.
	</p>
	<h4>V2.1.0.0 - 1 Jan 2004</h4>
	<p>
		Added new recommendation category for &lt; 15% capacity figure to advise about
		defragmenter limitation. Extended existing recommendation messages.<br />
		Added the &quot;Set to 15%&quot; button facility to the&nbsp; Modify dialog - again regarding the defrag facility.<br />
		Added &quot;Run Explorer&quot; command to the context menu to quickly open Explorer
		expanded at the appropriate disk drive.<br />
		Changed nomenclature to match names used by Explorer.<br />
		Dynamically update the text of the mouse-over (non-balloon) tooltip to reflect
		the current free space.<br />
		Changed the refresh timers to be less intrusive. Refresh less often (now starts
		at 5 mins - was 2 mins, increasing to 2 hours - was 1 hour), display the balloon
		tip for a slightly shorter period (10 secs).<br />
		Allow the subsequent non-display of the balloon tooltip in the current session.
	</p>
	<h4>V2.0.0.2 - 1 Nov 2002</h4>
	<p>
		Resolves a problem with unregistered usage that could result in Explorer
		hanging if the startup notification message was allowed to timeout. The message
		now displays as a topmost window.
	</p>
	<h4>V2.0 0 - 2 Oct 2002</h4>
	<p>
		Although this is V2, it&#39;s the first release of this major change from the
		original Win98 specific SpaceCon program.
	</p>
