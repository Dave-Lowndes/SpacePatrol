			    Space Patrol V2.2.1.1
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Space Patrol monitors your local hard disk drives for low disk space and
provides a notification when the configurable threshold level is reached.

Space Patrol can be used on any of the supported Windows operating systems.

Unlike the built-in provision in some of the Windows operating systems,
Space Patrol gives you full control over the threshold level and, where
possible, provides a consistent notification user interface for all
supported operating systems.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
			      Installation
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

You can execute the SpaceCon.msi file directly from your web browser (if
you're accessing Space Patrol from our web site), or download it and run it
from your hard disk, or from the supplied floppy disk (if you've ordered
one with your registration).

If you don't have an up-to-date copy of the Windows Installer, you may
need to install a more recent version.

For Windows 9x/ME use this URL:

http://download.microsoft.com/download/WindowsInstaller/Install/2.0/W9XMe/EN-US/InstMsiA.exe

For Windows NT/2000, use this one:

http://download.microsoft.com/download/WindowsInstaller/Install/2.0/NT45/EN-US/InstMsiW.exe

If Microsoft have changed the location of these redistributables, try
the following starting point and look for the Windows Installer
Redistributables:

http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/


The setup will copy files to your computer and then prompt you for your
registration information (which you can skip if you're evaluating it).

During setup, you'll have the opportunity to configure the settings, and once
you've completed that, the last step of Setup informs you that Space Patrol
is installed and briefly tells you how to use it. If you're upgrading an
existing version, setup may need to restart Windows.

Installing under Windows NT (NT4, 2000, XP, Windows 2003 Server, Vista) 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

You need to run the installation from an account with Administrator 
privileges.

Administration Installation
---------------------------

The installer supports the MSI administative installation options.

For example:

	msiexec /jm spacecon.msi

"Advertises" Space Patrol on all the machine's users Programs menu items.
When a user invokes the Start->Programs->JD Design->Space Patrol->Readme
option, the installation will complete.

or:
	msiexec /a spacecon.msi

Performs an "administrative" installation to a shared network location.


Files Installed by Setup
------------------------

Setup copies the following files to the installation folder:

SpaceCon.exe	The Space Patrol configuration program
SPMonitor.exe	The Space Patrol monitor program
SpaceCon.hlp	Help for Space Patrol
SpaceCon.txt	This file

Setup will also add relevant registry entries and Start menu items.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------
			How Do You Use Space Patrol?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Setup configures Space Patrol to start monitoring automatically when you log
onto the computer. It does this by a shortcut in the user's Startup Programs
menu group.

You can configure Space Patrol during Setup, or at any time, by using
Start->Programs->JD Design->Space Patrol->Configure Space Patrol.

Space Patrol displays your disk drive information and suggests where you may 
want to alter the setting. The monitoring can be enabled per-disk drive, and
for those operating systems that have an inbuilt low disk space notification
facility, Space Patrol lets you disable the OS facility.

For Windows 98/ME this check box mirrors the facility in the Windows Disk
Cleanup, Settings dialog box - but it does it for all your disk drives.

For Windows XP this setting affects the
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Explorer
NoLowDiskSpaceChecks registry setting. See MS Knowledge Base article Q285107
for the details of this setting.

1. To alter the threshold setting, select the drive and double click (or 
use the Modify button).

2. Alter the notification level using the "Modify Notification Threshold" 
dialog.

3. If you want to disable the operating system facility, check the "Disable
operating system's built-in low-disk space checking facility" button.

4. When you've configured the settings to be how you want them, press the
Apply button to commit the settings. Note that this operation requires
privilege to write to restricted areas of the registry, so if you're not an
adminstrator this operation may fail - it will inform you if it does.

If you've altered the settings so that the low space setting is effective you
should see a notification icon appear in the taskbar notification area. On
newer operating systems you'll also get a more visible balloon tooltip shown
for a few seconds. This balloon tooltip will re-appear periodically, getting
less frequent the longer the low space situation persists - so as not to
annoy you too much!


An unregistered version contains the full functionality, but won't
automatically apply the saved settings when you log on - you have to run the
"Configure Space Patrol" menu item and press the Apply button.

Revision History
----------------

V2.2.1.1  7 Aug 2008
----------------------
Fix for unregistered operation under Windows Vista. If you allowed the
initial notification message box to time out, the monitor process would close.

V2.2.1.0  26 Nov 2006
----------------------
Windows Vista compatible version.
Reworked to separate the monitoring and configuration functionality into
separate programs so that it works with Vista UAC.

V2.2.0.0  9 April 2006
----------------------
Installation defaults to "everyone".
Cosmetic changes to balloon tooltip texts.
Adopted the new registration number scheme used by our other products.
Fix some potential issues highlighted by Visual Studio's static code
analysis & Application Verifier tools.

V2.1.0.1  19 April 2004
-----------------------
Fixes a cosmetic issue where the "Disable operating system's built-in
low-disk space checking facility" check box was not being set correctly under
Windows 98.

V2.1.0.0  1 Jan 2004
--------------------
Added new recommendation category for < 15% capacity figure to advise about
defragmenter limitation. Extended existing recommendation messages.
Added the "Set to 15%" button facility to the the Modify dialog - again
w.r.t. the defrag facility.
Added "Run Explorer" command to the context menu to quickly open Explorer
expanded at the appropriate disk drive.
Changed nomenclature to match names used by Explorer.
Dynamically update the text of the mouse-over (non-ballon) tooltip to reflect
the current free space.
Changed the refresh timers to be less intrusive. Refresh less often (now

Allow the subsequent non-display of the balloon tooltip in the current
session.

-----------------
Although this is V2, it's the first release of this major change from the
original Win98 specific SpaceCon program.
